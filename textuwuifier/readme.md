This is a small thing I made at school, both for a friend and for my personal use, outputs are hilarious and it also isn't that hard to use!

Libraries used:
npm i uwuifier https://github.com/Schotsl/Uwuifier-node
npm i node-fetch https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch
npm i fs (should be pre-installed with node, idk)
